## Description

Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. The site is built from scratch, following the MVC paradigm, and is deployed to Heroku. It uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
